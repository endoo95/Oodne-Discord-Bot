# Oodne-Discord-Bot
Discord bot. Probably only for music, but who knows? 

ver. 1.0
Build at first attempt with discord.py, and youtube_dll. I had problems with it so i've changed to nextcord and wavelink.
So now it's nextcord and wavelink (you need to download them). It's playing music from YT or Spotify link. It follows commands like:
- play
- splay (for spotify)
- stop
- pause
- resume
- next
- join
- kick
- nowplaying
- loop
- queue
- volume

This version obviously is not best, have many bugs, etc. but next version will be rebuild for use with "slash commands". Then i'll fix the rest in smaller updates.

utility.py is formed as follow:
TOKEN = "your_token"
SPOTIFY_SECRET = "your_secret"
